# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Star-The-Office
In this project, I used Python to solve a real-world data science problem by using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib, manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots that I created to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office".

## 📺 Projects
### [Guided project](https://github.com/dnguyennk/Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Star-The-Office/tree/main/guided_project)

*Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.*

#### Project tasks
1. Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. Provide your answer to the question "Are we certain that movies are getting shorter?


### [Unguided project](https://github.com/dnguyennk/Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Star-The-Office/tree/main/unguided_project)

#### Project task
1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
- Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
- Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
- A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
  + Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
  + Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
  + Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
  + Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
- A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
- A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
- An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
- A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
2. Provide the name of one of the guest stars who was in the most watched Office episode.
